# java-dataframe-operations
A custom implementation of core DataFrame functionality in Java, inspired by Python’s pandas library. This project demonstrates skills in data structures, algorithm design, and backend data processing for tabular datasets.

Overview
This project implements a lightweight DataFrame system in Java capable of:

Creating and storing tabular data, 
Filtering rows based on conditions, 
Grouping and aggregating data, 
Selecting and sorting columns, 
Joining two DataFrames, 
and Performing summary statistics

It is designed to mimic essential operations of analytics libraries such as pandas and R data.frames, but built entirely from scratch using Java OOP principles.

Features:
DataFrame Creation, 
Filtering, 
GroupBy + Aggregate, 
Sorting, 
Joining, 
and Column Selection
